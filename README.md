This is just a scratch area for MMD manipulation tools.

It isn't organised for reuse simply because I'm still trying to get it to work.

* mmd/vmd - code to read and write VMD files
* test.rb - run this with some .vmd files as parameters to see if the reading code works.
* glue.rb - utility to glue together two vmd files into a single file.
